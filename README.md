# Shell Script Collection

This repository contains a collection of simple Bash shell scripts for various basic programming tasks, commonly used in Operating Systems labs or for learning shell scripting fundamentals.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. sieve_primes_1_to_100.sh
Finds and prints all prime numbers from 1 to 100 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

### 2. frequency_count_while.sh
Counts the frequency of each element in a predefined array using a while loop.

### 3. bubble_sort.sh
Sorts a predefined array of numbers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and prints the sorted array.

### 4. input_array_eliment_show.sh
Prompts the user to input array elements and then displays the entered array.

### 5. count_even_odd.sh
Counts and prints the number of even and odd numbers in a predefined array.

### 6. prime.sh
Prints all prime numbers from 2 to 100 using a basic primality test.

### 7. leap_year.sh
Checks if a given year (input by the user) is a leap year.

### 8. fact.sh
Calculates and prints the factorial of a user-input number.

### 9. sum_even_1_100.sh
Calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

### 10. divisible_5_11.sh
Checks if a user-input number is divisible by both 5 and 11.

### 11. even_odd.sh
Checks if a user-input number is even or odd.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Bash installed on your system (most Unix/Linux systems have it by default).
2. To run a script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash script_name.sh
```

- For scripts that require user input, follow the prompts after running the script.
- For scripts with predefined arrays, you can modify the array values inside the script as needed.
